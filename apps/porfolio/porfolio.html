     <h1>Sale<span>20% OFF</span>On Everything</h1>
     <p>The 20% Discount Sales Promotion is designed to attract customers by offering a reduced price on select items across various product categories. During this promotional period, customers can enjoy a 20% discount on electronics, gadgets, and accessories, such as laptops, smartphones, and headphones. 
        The promotion aims to boost sales by enhancing the value customers receive, encouraging larger purchases, and increasing customer satisfaction. For each item, the original price is displayed alongside the discount amount and the final price after applying the discount. For example, a laptop originally priced at $1,000 will be available for $800 after the 20% reduction, saving the customer $200. 
        This straightforward discount model not only simplifies the purchasing process but also highlights the substantial savings, making it easier for 
        customers to make quick and informed buying decisions.</p>
